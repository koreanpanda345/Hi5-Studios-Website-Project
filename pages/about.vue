        Matthias uploaded his first video in 2011.
        It got a couple thousand views but inspired him to create even more content.
        What had started as a way to build his portfolio had turned into so much more.
        In 2012, Matthias committed to regularly uploading on YouTube in an effort to build his standing.
        He reformulated and put in time to write new content.
        Matthias began making music video parodies & covers. One year later he had hit 22,000 subscribers.
        Matthias began to dabble in sketch comedy, starting with his series “6 Second Sketches.”
        At the time, he had begun to work with Awesomeness TV helping them write sketches.
        <br><br>
        As his channel kept growing, so did his ideas for content.
        He began a second channel where he would daily vlog with his wife Amanda and then a third for gaming content.
        Matthias’ work with Awesomeness TV began to dwindle allowing for him and Amanda to produce more content for their channels.
        They began to hustle hard producing 14 videos a week. Matthias had changed his content from him being more of an actor to being a personality.
        He began to collaborate with other YouTubers like Markiplier, JacksFilms, and Jon Cozart.
        As he began collaborating with others, he grew his audience and began experimenting with different kinds of content.
        Matthias was drawn to challenge based content.
        With this switch in style, his brother-in-law Bryan pitched him the idea of Team Edge, a channel dedicated to challenges between brothers.
        They got Matthias’ brother Joey on board and began shooting three videos every weekend.
        <br><br>
        Team Edge began to grow out of the garage and the brothers reached a point where they had to decide whether they were going to take this channel to the next level or they were going to need to start looking for jobs.
        They all decided to move from the garage to an office building.
        That was the beginning of Hi5 Studios.
        As they continued growing, they kept hiring more help to develop more channels.
        Hi5 Studios was founded on the idea of creating a network of wholesome, family content.
        To this day, Hi5 Studios seeks to create content that brings joy to the homes of families.
