        Disclaimer: This is not the official Hi5 Studio website. You can find the official one <a class="text-blue" href="https://hi5studios.com">here</a>. This is just a fun project I want to do.
        I am not claiming anything you see on this website as mine. All credit goes to Hi5 Studio.
        They have the power to ask for this to be remove, and it will happen.
        This also means that I can't put the down members of Hi5 Studio, and pictures of them without consent, which I don't have.
        This is to protect their privacy, and respect them as people.
